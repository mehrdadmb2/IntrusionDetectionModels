### üìç Introduction
This project is a Python-based solution for **network intrusion detection**. We use a variety of deep learning models to analyze and detect anomalies in network traffic. The models used include:
- LSTM
- GRU
- CNN-LSTM
- BiLSTM

The project includes data extraction, preprocessing, transformation to time-series, and evaluation tools for each model, making it a comprehensive framework for analyzing network data.

## üìë Features
- **Automatic Library Installation**: Installs required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.
- **Data Extraction and Preprocessing**: Combines multiple CSV files from a ZIP archive, removes invalid data, and scales features.
- **Time-Series Data Preparation**: Converts data into sequences suitable for time-series models.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Supports LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, and BiLSTM for comparative analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy, classification reports, ROC AUC, and F1 Score for each model.

## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehrdadmb2/IntrusionDetectionModels.git
   cd IntrusionDetectionModels
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   Make sure you have `requirements.txt` in the `IOT/HW3/For Me/` directory. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python intrusion_detection.py
   ```

3. **Download and Extract CICIDS 2017 Dataset**
   - Place the dataset ZIP file in `IOT/HW3/For Me/` and ensure it's named `CICIDS 2017.zip`.

## üß© Helper Functions
- **install_requirements**: Automatically installs libraries from `requirements.txt`.
- **extract_and_combine_csv**: Extracts CSV files from ZIP and combines them into a single file.
- **preprocess_data**: Cleans and scales the dataset.
- **create_time_series**: Transforms data for time-series models.
- **train_and_evaluate_model**: Trains and evaluates a model, providing metrics and plots.

## üîç Example Usage
After setting up and running the script, you can view the performance metrics and comparison charts for each model. Example outputs include:
- **Accuracy**: Displays overall accuracy of each model.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, F1 score, and support.
- **ROC AUC Score**: Measures the area under the ROC curve.
- **F1 Score**: Provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall.
